# MultiTools — Local-First AI Media Suite (Extended)

MultiTools is a high-performance, professional-grade media processing and productivity platform built for journalists, researchers, and professionals who need a powerful, privacy-first toolkit in the browser.

Key selling points:

- Local-first: files and transcripts are stored locally and scoped per user.
- Powerful AI: integrates Google Gemini for transcription, OCR, image analysis, and multi-personality TTS.
- Feature-rich: transcription with diarization, batch OCR, PDF/document conversion, audio/video utilities, grammar correction, and exports.

Quick Start (for end users):

1. Open the app in your browser (development server or deployed site).
2. Upload your audio/video or images.
3. Use the Transcriber or OCR pipelines; export results as needed.

Commercial and privacy notes:

- By default, MultiTools does not upload files to cloud storage.
- AI features require a Gemini API key (set by the site operator in production environments).
